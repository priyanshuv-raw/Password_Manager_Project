# Password_Manager_Project
Let's create a password manager application for web using python.

I have created this basic password manager where you can encrypt your passsword using cryptography.
And for using it for the first time you need to remove the comments from function defintion write_key()
And then it will create a key in the same directory then you can comment again and you are ready to use it.
And also keep in mind to change the master password within the if else condition where Mustang@123 is written.
This is a CUI based Password Manager
